# Holberton School - Web Front-End

This repository contains all the projects completed during the **Web Front-End** curriculum at Holberton School. The focus is on mastering the fundamental technologies of the web—**HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**—with an emphasis on modern web development practices, responsive design, and toolchains.

The projects progress from basic semantic HTML and simple styling to advanced CSS techniques, responsive layouts, CSS pre-processors (SASS), and modern asset bundling with Webpack.
